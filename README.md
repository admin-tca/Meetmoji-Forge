# 🧿 Meetmoji Forge  
**The Ritual Calendar Crafter — Where Time Meets Glyph**  
*...and where your visual processing cortex takes over from your guilt-ridden monkey mind!*

---

## 📖 What is Meetmoji Forge?

**Meetmoji Forge** is a handcrafted calendaring ritual tool that generates `.ics` files for your academic year — complete with phase-based planning blocks and visually anchored, emoji-clock-coded meeting slots.

This is not a generic scheduling app.  
It is a **semantic time protocol**.  
A **cognitive architecture**.  
A tool to bring order, rhythm, and signal to your collaborative life.

You don’t schedule meetings with guilt.  
You schedule them by asking:  
**“What animal face are you today?”** 🐻🦊🦡🦉

---

## 🎯 Why This Exists

Most calendars are built for compliance — not cognition.

They assume your brain is a command-line buffer:  
linear, overclocked, contextless.

But human minds aren’t machines. They are:

- **Visual**
- **Rhythmic**
- **Symbolic**
- **Context-sensitive**

**Meetmoji Forge** is designed from first principles to support high-coherence scheduling across global teams, without sacrificing clarity or dignity.

It works by:

- Aligning to the **natural flow of the academic year**
- Building in **cognitive affordances** (24–25 min slots with decompression time)
- Anchoring to **global cities** and fair-time blocks
- Using **deterministic emoji-hour tags** (via EBI24_CLOCK) for symbolic shorthand
- Outputting **modular, shareable `.ics` files** ready to drop into any modern calendar

No apps. No cloud. Just clean, meaningful time encoded in human-readable glyphs.

## 🗺️ System Overview

- 📅 **Academic Calendar Basis**  
  Anchored on the European academic year (default: September 15).  
  Each year is broken into:
  - Semester A
  - Downtime A→B
  - Semester B (Flame)
  - Summer Rest
  - Deep Work Phase
  - Preflight Prep

- ⏰ **Time Slot Design**  
  Each weekday includes **8 time slots**, recurring every **3 weeks**, with:
  - 25 minutes focus time
  - 5-minute decompression buffer
  - Anchored at humane, cross-zone times (e.g., 13:30–13:55 JST)

- 🌐 **Time Zone Anchors**  
  Time slots are generated for:
  - 🗼 Tokyo
  - 🕌 Delhi
  - 🏛 Brussels
  - 🏛 Washington DC
  - 🏞 Seattle  
  *(Optional: Oceania-specific Monday/Friday slots)*

- 🧠 **Emoji Time Protocol — EBI24_CLOCK**  
  Each slot is tagged with a **unique animal face emoji** representing its UTC hour.  
  These emojis are carefully chosen to:
  - Be phonetically distinct
  - Avoid cultural offense
  - Enable clear communication even over poor connections

- 🗃 **Output Structure**  
  Each `.ics` file contains:
  - One phase (e.g., `semester_a`)
  - All meeting slots for that phase
  - All-day events for planning blocks (e.g., "Summer Rest")

## 🔁 What Changed: From Random Emojis to Ritual Time Glyphs

Originally, each meeting slot was assigned a randomized emoji.  
But over time, this caused friction:

- Duplicates across phases
- No meaningful way to speak or recall a time
- Confusion across languages and screen readers

We replaced this with **EBI24_CLOCK**: a deterministic mapping of each **UTC hour → animal face emoji**, similar to a phonetic alphabet or ritual lexicon.

> “Let’s meet at **Badger Face Thirty** next Thursday.”  
> “I’m free only during **Fox Face** or **Wolf Face** slots today.”

## 🧬 The EBI24_CLOCK

| Hour (UTC) | Emoji | Description   |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| 00         | 🐶    | Dog Face       |
| 01         | 🐱    | Cat Face       |
| 02         | 🐭    | Mouse Face     |
| 03         | 🦝    | Raccoon Face   |
| 04         | 🐰    | Bunny Face     |
| 05         | 🦊    | Fox Face       |
| 06         | 🐻    | Bear Face      |
| 07         | 🐴    | Horse Face     |
| 08         | 🐐    | Goat Face      |
| 09         | 🐯    | Tiger Face     |
| 10         | 🦁    | Lion Face      |
| 11         | 🦬    | Bison Face     |
| 12         | 🐸    | Frog Face      |
| 13         | 🦥    | Sloth Face     |
| 14         | 🐔    | Chicken Face   |
| 15         | 🦔    | Hedgehog Face  |
| 16         | 🦡    | Badger Face    |
| 17         | 🦜    | Parrot Face    |
| 18         | 🐺    | Wolf Face      |
| 19         | 🦆    | Duck Face      |
| 20         | 🦉    | Owl Face       |
| 21         | 🦇    | Bat Face       |
| 22         | 🐢    | Turtle Face    |
| 23         | 🐵    | Monkey Face    |

Each meeting slot uses:

```text
<Emoji> <Animal Face Name> + <Minute Offset>
e.g., 🦡 Badger Face Thirty → UTC 16:30
```

---

## 📦 Output

The tool generates:

- output/semester_phases.ics → all-day blocks per calendar phase
- output/meeting_<phase>.ics → detailed 25-minute meeting slots for that phase

Each event contains:

```text
SUMMARY: Tokyo 🦊 Fox Face Slot (13:30–13:55 JST)
DESCRIPTION: Autogenerated keywords (e.g., 🤖🔐☕️💬 — Semester A (Seed))
CLASS: Always PRIVATE
```

## 🛠 Configuration

Located at the top of meetmoji_forge.py under # 🔧 USER CONFIGURATION.

You can control:

- Start date of the academic year
- Enable/disable Oceania slots
- Series rotation intervals
- Time zone block selection
- Dry-run vs actual .ics generation

No external libraries are required — just Python 3.

## 🧪 Usage

```python
git clone https://github.com/admin-tca/meetmoji-forge.git
cd meetmoji-forge
python3 meetmoji_forge.py --year=2039
```

Use --dry-run to simulate or inspect the output without writing .ics files.

## 🙏 On Prayer Times and Rhythmic Coexistence

Meetmoji Forge is a secular tool — but it honors the rhythms of spiritual time.

Over 1.8 billion Muslims pray at five specific solar times daily. We have cross-checked our scheduling blocks to avoid overlapping:

| Prayer  | Common Time Range (local) | Conflict                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Fajr    | \~05:00–06:00             | ❌ None                                    |
| Dhuhr   | \~12:30–13:45             | ⚠️ Possible partial overlap (13:30 slots) |
| Asr     | \~15:30–17:30             | ✅ Avoided                                 |
| Maghrib | \~19:00–20:00             | ❌ None                                    |
| Isha    | \~20:00–22:00             | ❌ None                                    |

We recommend:

- Adjusting slot usage in high-observance contexts
- Recognizing solar, cultural, and ritual time as equally valid
- Treating scheduling with empathy and elasticity

🧭 Where time meets glyph, let conscience meet cadence.

## 💬 Suggested Usage Flow

1. Import .ics files into your calendar.
2. To book a meeting:
- Ask: “What weekday + region are you in?”
- Look for that region’s available slots.
- Pick a slot, rename the emoji to the person’s name.
3. Send it with:
> “You’re my 🐸 Frog Face meeting this cycle — see you then!”

## 🧭 Design Philosophy: Semantic Resilience

This project is rooted in the Threshold Continuity Alliance's broader doctrine:

When systems degrade, symbolic coherence matters most.
Meetmoji Forge aims to remain legible:

- Across time zones
- Across languages
- Across connection types
- Across collapse

If nothing else survives but paper calendars and emoji glyphs,
Badger Face Thirty will still make sense.

Calendars should be kind.
Time should be meaningful.
Coherence is not optional.
